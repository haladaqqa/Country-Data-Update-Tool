## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my CS1026 Assignment 4, which focuses on updating and managing country information using Python classes.

### Learning Outcomes:

By completing this assignment, I gained skills relating to:

- Strings and text files.
- Writing and using custom classes.
- Using complex data structures (i.e., lists, sets, and dictionaries).
- Testing code and developing test cases; adhering to specifications.

## Project Files

The project includes the following key files:

- `data.txt`: The master data file containing information about countries.
- `upd.txt`: The updates file for applying changes to the master data.
- `main.py`: The main program for processing the updates.
- `processUpdates.py`: A Python script for updating and managing the data files.
- `catalogue.py`: A Python module defining the `CountryCatalogue` class.
- `country.py`: A Python module defining the `Country` class.

## Getting Started

To run the project and apply updates to the country data file, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `main.py` script to begin the updating process.

## Usage

The main program, `main.py`, prompts you for the names of the data and update files and invokes the `processUpdates` function to update the country data.

You can customize your own update files and apply changes to the country information.
